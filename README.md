# raytracer
A simple raytracer (specifically, a pathtracer) written in C++ based on "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley.

At the moment I'm just following along with the material and trying to understand the fundamentals of pathtracing techniques.

In the future, I plan to make this raytracer more physically-based by taking into account different wavelengths of light.
